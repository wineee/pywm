# pywm-atha - a fork of pywm

~~Unfortunately, newm as well as pywm are currently unmaintained.~~

pywm-atha is an abstraction layer for [newm-atha](https://sr.ht/~atha/newm-atha) encapsulating all c code.

Basically this is a very tiny compositor built on top of [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots), making all the assumptions that wlroots does not.
On the Python side pywm exposes Wayland clients (XDG and XWayland) as so-called views and passes along all input. 
This way, handling the positioning of views, animating their movement, ... based on keystrokes or touchpad inputs (i.e. the logical, not performance-critical part of any compositor) is possible Python-side,
 whereas rendering and all other performance-critical aspects are handled by C code.

Check the Python class `PyWM` and c struct `wm_server` for a start, as well as newms `Layout`. 

## BUT WHY PYTHON?????

when you use a custom configuration DSL, i.e sway/i3/hyprland, you can set values but not do anything creative to get said values.

With python, you can do lots of complex(or not so complex) and creative things to get values to set.


## Install

you should have no reason to install this, it is installed as a dependency of newm-atha


### Build Dependenices

Prerequisites for PyWM, apart from Python, are given by [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/):

* python and pip
* gcc, meson and ninja
* pkg-config
* wayland
* wayland-protocols
* xorg-xwayland
* EGL
* GLESv2
* libdrm
* GBM
* libinput
* xkbcommon
* udev
* pixman
* libseat


```
pip3 install git+https://git.sr.ht/~atha/pywm-atha
```

In case of issues, clone the repo and execute `meson build && ninja -C build` in order to debug.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via key-value pairs given to the `PyWM` contructor:

### Troubleshooting

#### seatd

Be aware that current wlroots requires `seatd` under certain circumstances. Example systemd service (be sure to place your user in group `_seatd`):

```
[Unit]
Description=Seat management daemon
Documentation=man:seatd(1)

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=seatd -g _seatd
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
